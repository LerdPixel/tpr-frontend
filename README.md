# Subject area
There are courses in which this approach needs to be implemented. These courses are subsections of a larger course on decision theory and soft computing, such as fuzzy logic. These courses overlap in lectures, seminars, labs, and assessments. Each new semester, a progress report is created for several courses, to which student groups are assigned. A course includes lectures, seminars, labs, a final test, and an exam. The teaching staff plays a key role in the educational process. Lectures are taught by a single instructor, who also monitors attendance and records attendance. Seminars are taught by multiple instructors, each responsible for a specific number of non-overlapping groups, as each group must have only one seminarian. At the end of the semester, each student in a course must receive a grade reflecting the student's performance from various perspectives. It is formed by adding together the points earned for the exam, final test, lab work, and lecture attendance. The instructor also allocates a certain number of points for extracurricular activities, such as active participation in classes, additional assignments, or project contributions. The exact number is determined by the principal instructor during the course's development, but the total should be 100 points, of which 50 are for the exam and final test, and the remaining 50 for lecture attendance, lab work, and extracurricular activities.
